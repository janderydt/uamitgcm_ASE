This repository contains the Matlab scripts that were used to plot the figures in [De Rydt and Naughten 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1587).

The scripts require the Matlab ÚaMITgcm toolbox, which is linked as a submodule.

ÚaMITgcm configuration files can be found [here](https://github.com/knaughten/UaMITgcm/tree/archer2/example/PTDC_999).

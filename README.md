**Repository in support of [De Rydt and Naughten 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1587)

The repository contains Matlab scripts to
* Produce the figures in [De Rydt and Naughten 2023](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1587).
* Process the raw Úa-MITgcm output produced for the figures. This requires the Úa-MITgcm toolbox, which is linked as a submodule. To clone the toolbox, use `git clone --recursive` instead of just `git clone`.

a regional configuration of the coupled ice-ocean model Úa-MITgcm was developed for the paper. The Úa and MITgcm input files for this setup can be found [here](https://github.com/knaughten/UaMITgcm/tree/archer2/example/PTDC_999).
